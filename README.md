# Design-to-Code Bridge

[Live Preview](https://www.design-to-code-bridge.com/) | [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/mirabelledoiron/D2C-technical-documentation-hub/wiki) | [Product Roadmap](https://github.com/users/mirabelledoiron/projects/3)

The **Design-to-Code Bridge** is a professional UX Engineering tool designed to bridge the gap between design system variables and production-ready code. It automates the extraction, transformation, and distribution of design tokens to ensure high-fidelity implementation.

> **Note**: The core engine and source code for this application are hosted in a [Private Repository](https://github.com/mirabelledoiron/Design-to-Code-Bridge). This hub serves as the public architectural case study and technical documentation.

## The UXE Process: Design to Production
As a UX Engineer, this project represents a full-cycle product workflow, ensuring that design intent is preserved with 100% accuracy in the final build:

1. **System Architecture**: Defining a scalable token model that supports CSS, SCSS, JSON, and Tailwind formats.
2. **Logic and State**: Leveraging [Zustand](https://github.com/mirabelledoiron/D2C-technical-documentation-hub/wiki/State-Management-Strategy) for high-performance state management, allowing for instant token manipulation.
3. **UI/UX Implementation**: Utilizing Radix UI and Tailwind CSS to create an accessible, responsive, and predictable user interface.
4. **Engineering Rigor**: Using TypeScript to ensure data integrity during the complex [Figma API transformation](https://github.com/mirabelledoiron/D2C-technical-documentation-hub/wiki/Figma-API-Integration).
